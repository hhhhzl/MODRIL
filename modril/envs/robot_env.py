        action_space: The Space object corresponding to valid actions

        reward_range: A tuple corresponding to the min and max possible rewards

    Note: a default reward range set to [-inf,+inf] already exists. Set it if you want a narrower range.

    The methods are accessed publicly as "step", "reset", etc.. The
